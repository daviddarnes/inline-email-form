# Inline email form

[Check out the demo](http://daviddarnes.github.io/inline-email-form/).

## What?

You click a thing and an email form appear, all slick-like.

## Why?

Because [Mike designed it](https://dribbble.com/shots/2197764-Inline-email-form), [Mark inspired it](https://twitter.com/pixxel/status/631409650001424384) and I thought I could make it in an evening.

## How?

With a checkbox toggle, some animations and the power of formspree.
